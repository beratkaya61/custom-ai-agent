    "and Henri Becquerel. Later, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for her work on radium and\n",
    "polonium. During World War I, she developed mobile radiography units, known as 'petites Curies',\n",
    "to provide X-ray services to field hospitals. Marie Curie died in 1934 from aplastic anemia, likely\n",
    "caused by her long-term exposure to radiation.\n",

    "Key figures in the battle include Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, then a young Ottoman commander, who played a critical role in organizing the defense at Anafartalar and Conkbayırı. His leadership and famous command, “I do not order you to attack; I order you to die,” became legendary and cemented his status as a national hero. On the Allied side, commanders like General Ian Hamilton struggled with underestimating the terrain and Ottoman resistance, leading to heavy casualties.\n",

    "The campaign ended in failure for the Allies after months of stalemate, suffering over 250,000 casualties on each side. For the Ottomans, the victory became a symbol of national pride and resistance. For Australia and New Zealand, whose ANZAC troops fought valiantly, it marked a tragic but formative experience that is commemorated annually on ANZAC Day, April 25. The battle significantly shaped Turkish national identity and contributed to the eventual founding of the Republic of Turkey under Atatürk.\n",

    "The Gallipoli Campaign is remembered for its strategic blunders, the harsh conditions faced by soldiers, and the heroism displayed on both sides.
