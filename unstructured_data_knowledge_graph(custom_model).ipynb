    "polonium. During World War I, she developed mobile radiography units, known as 'petites Curies',\n",
    "to provide X-ray services to field hospitals. Marie Curie died in 1934 from aplastic anemia, likely\n",
    "caused by her long-term exposure to radiation.\n",

    "she earned degrees in physics and mathematics. She met Pierre Curie, a professor of physics, in 1894, \n",
